The correct way to thread in Qt is to prepare an object/worker (QObject) class with all your desired functionality in it. Then create a new QThread instance, push the QObject onto it using moveToThread(QThread*) of the QObject instance and call start() on the QThread instance. That's all. You set up the proper signal/slot connections to make it quit properly and such, and that's all.



Do NOT subclass Qthread and implement your own run() function. This is wrong. A QThread should be used much like a a regular thread instance (^ follow above instructions)
Also not that QThread is not actually a thread; it's a wrapper around a thread object.
